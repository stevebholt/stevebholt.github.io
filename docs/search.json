One mechanism by which teachers might affect student learning is through the grading standards they set for their classrooms. However, the effects of grading standards on student outcomes are relatively understudied. Using administrative data that links individual students and teachers in 8th and 9th grade Algebra I classrooms from 2006 to 2016, we examine the effects of teachers’ grading standards on student learning and attendance. High teacher grading standards in Algebra I increase student learning both in Algebra I and in subsequent math classes. The effect on student achievement is positive and similar in size across student characteristics and levels of ability, students’ relative rank within the classroom, and school context. High teacher grading standards also lead to a modest reduction in student absences.\n\n\nCitation\nGershenson, S., Holt, S. B., & Tyner, A. (2022).

We use administrative data from North Carolina elementary schools to examine the extent to which teachers vary in their use of referrals and investigate the impact of more punitive teachers on student attendance and achievement. We also estimate the effect of teachers’ racial bias in the use of referrals on student outcomes. We find more punitive teachers increase student absenteeism and reduce student achievement. Moreover, more punitive teachers negatively affect the achievement of students who do not receive disciplinary sanctions from the teacher. Similarly, while teachers with racial bias in the use of referrals do not negatively affect academic outcomes for White students, they significantly increase absenteeism and reduce achievement for Black students. We find the negative effects of both more punitive and more biased teachers persist into middle school and beyond. The results suggest punitive disciplinary measures do not aid teachers in productively managing classrooms; rather, teachers taking more punitive stances may undermine student engagement and learning in both the short- and long-run. Furthermore, bias in teachers’ referral usage contributes to inequities in student outcomes.\n\n\nCitation\nHolt, S. B., Vinopal, K., Choi, H., & Sorensen, L. C. (2022).

The current study uses the legislative removal of a cap on the maximum number of charters in North Carolina as a natural experiment to assess the impacts of charter school growth on teacher quality and student composition in traditional public schools (TPS) at different levels of local market penetration. Using an instrumental variable difference-in-differences approach to account for endogenous charter demand, we find that intensive local charter entry reduces the inflow of new teachers at nearby TPS, leading to a more experienced and credentialed teaching workforce on average. However, we find that the entry of charters serving predominantly White students leads to reductions in average teacher experience, effectiveness, and credentials at nearby TPS. Overall these findings suggest that the composition of the teacher workforce in TPS will continue to change as charter schools further expand, and that the spillover effects of future charter expansion will vary by the types of students served by charters.\n\n\nCitation\nSorensen, L.

Perhaps you’re wondering why I have directed you to a post on my professional website as an incoming advisee. Well, in my time at Rockefeller College, I’ve begun to realize that many students enter the program a little confused about navigating the bureaucracy of a university, a little confused about who to go to for what information, and anxious to get quick resolutions to these problems. I’ve also come to realize that I field many of the same questions repeatedly early on so I have found life might be a little easier for all involved if I simply created a central repository to house all of this information as a starting point for most common questions.\nI will structure this post with a general overview of the process for selecting classes, a more detailed set of starting semester courses, and some thoughts on common paths among students typically assigned to me for advising."

Well, for starters, my primary role in your time at the university is to make sure you stay on track to fulfill your degree requirements and provide insight and advice from time-to-time on things that might shape your early career path. Of course, there might be a whole host of other issues that crop up in your time at Rockefeller, from financial aid to taking temporary leaves to career and job opportunities. I find many students enter the program a little confused on where to go for information on which things, so here’s an incomplete list of people and places to get important information.\n\nYour MPA Program Handbook. I know - this sounds a little trite. But the faculty and staff poured a lot of time and thought into the design and information in the MPA Program Manual and it will always be the best place to start a search for college policies, program requirements, and directory informaion.\nThe Director of Internships and Career Services. If you have any questions or concerns about internship requirements (or waivers!) or internship/job postings, the Director should be the first person you email. In fact, this person is so important for your success, I strongly recommend you set up a meeting with them during your first semester to cover career goals and interests and get an early understanding of career opportunities. You can email career services here for any career and internship needs: rockefeller.careers@albany.edu.\nThe MPA Director. Currently, the MPA Director is Dr. Ellen Rubin and for advanced programmatic issues - credit transfers, issues with a class, or other more technical issues with the program - she is the person you should reach out to first (erubin@albany.edu).\nRockefeller College Graduate Services. We have staff that handle a range of other issues, from problems with accessing various systems to answering questions unrelated to class-taking. Email rockgradservices@albany.edu and they will either handle the issue directly or loop in the appropriate staff person to do so.\n\nAs you can see, there’s a lot of support for any issues that might come up. As your academic advisor, I play a very specific role in your time at the program and to save yourself time and headaches, I find that it’s good to know where to go for all the other things that might come up."

Toward that end, here is how the class selection process should look in a typical situation:\n\nAccess the schedule of classes website through the Registrar’s Office on the University at Albany website. You can use this link. Start by selecting the upcoming semester in the dropdown, make sure you select Graduate Classes only, and for most instances you will also be filtering by “RPAD” in the Course Subject field. Use this to peruse the courses available that semester and create your schedule of classes that fits your course requirements and scheduling needs.\nSend me an email with i) a list of the classes you’ve taken to date in the program (if any) and ii) your proposed schedule for the upcoming semester. If needed request a meeting to discuss any questions you might have about courses to take (often, this is productive if there are two electives you are considering and unsure which would be a better fit with your long-term goals)\nAfter confirming that your proposed schedule leaves you on track, I will send you an AVN.\nUse the AVN to register.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nOutside of the occassional circumstance regarding an elective choice, you generally do not need to meet with me unless you really find yourself lost and in need of clarification.

In your first two semesters, there are three possible approaches.\n\nApproach 1 - my recommended approach for most students who know their intended concentration on entry (except for Public Policy students) - provides a steady way to progress through the core while adding electives each semester to develop your more specialized concentration skills.\nApproach 2 - what I recommend for students on the fence between the two concentrations I advise (management or policy) OR who know from the start that they will be in the public policy concentration. For students on the fence, this approach gives you an early taste of what both concentrations emphasize to inform your decision without “wasting” an elective.1 For Public Policy students, this approach covers the prerequisites for the two required electives that have prerequisites.\nApproach 3 - which I only recommend in circumstances where a student is truly and completely undecided in their concentration intentions - gives you an upfront spread of more general classes to help you answer that question before taking electives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSemester\nApproach 1\nApproach 2\nApproach 3\n\n\n\n\nFirst\nRPAD 500, RPAD 504, Elective 1\nRPAD 500, RPAD 503, RPAD 505\nRPAD 500, RPAD 501, RPAD 504\n\n\nSecond\nRPAD 502, RPAD 505, Elective 2\n(if Policy) RPAD 504, RPAD 522, RPAD 643; (if Management) RPAD 505, RPAD 610, Elective 2\nRPAD 503, RPAD 505, Elective 1\n\n\nGoing Forward\n2 cores, 1 elective per semester\n2 cores, 1 elective per semester\n2 electives, 1 core per semester\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nA subtlety many students might not pickup on is that core classes are, by necessity, offered on a guaranteed and frequent schedule, while electives have a less gauranteed schedule in their cycling and offerings.

The unpredictability of scheduling becomes even more severe when considering electives operated by another department.

The primary aim of taking this concentration is to learn how to manage the people and projects that make government run, regardless of what area of government you would like to be operating within. As you may have noticed, RPAD 610 is required for the concentration and I recommend taking it in your first semester if you are following approach 1 (i.e., you are coming in knowing you want to be in the public management concetration) or your second semester if you have decided to go the public management route after entering undecided.\nFrom there, my general recommendation is you take the following classes as they are available in scheduling following the 1 elective per semester approach:\n\nRPAD 532 Performance Measurement and Contracting\nRPAD 615 Strategic Planning and Management\n\nThis leaves you with one elective to explore other topics or areas of interest to you. I suggest using it to take either RPAD 626 (Program Evaluation) as it provides a broadly applicable skillset or a policy topics class based on your area of content interest (e.g., health policy, environmental policy, education policy - see the policy concentration in the handbook/below). If you have a job in a particular agency in mind (e.g., New York State Education Department), using your elective on a content class in that department’s area can help signal your interest and knowledge on the front end and catch you up on the broader sets of issues and current debates for helping your work once you get started.\nA good example plan:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSemester\nClasses\n\n\n\n\nFirst\nRPAD 500, RPAD 504, RPAD 610\n\n\nSecond\nRPAD 502, RPAD 501, RPAD 532 OR RPAD 615 (pending availability)\n\n\nThird\nRPAD 506, RPAD 505, RPAD 532 OR RPAD 615 (whichever not taken)\n\n\nFourth\nRPAD 503, RPAD 507, RPAD 626 OR Policy Topic Elective"

However, unlike the public management concentration, the Public Policy concentration carries a little less flexibility in your coursework and sequencing. While generally we have moved away from specific pathing in our curriculum, the Policy concentration covers some more advanced technical material in its core - material that necessitates some prerequisite knowledge to get the most out of it. I think it’s generally a good idea to take RPAD 503 (a prerequisite for RPAD 643) and RPAD 505 (a prerequisite for RPAD 626) in your first semester if you know you are going to be a public policy concentration student. From there, you will take both RPAD 522 (Politics and Policy) and RPAD 643 (Economics of Public Policy) as they are available (every Spring semester). You will then take RPAD 626 in your second Fall semester. Finally, I recommend dedicating your last elective either to one of the content area policy classes (e.g., health, environmental, or education policy) that aligns with your interests or to an advanced econometrics class if possible (RPAD 517 or a more advanced class - talk to me if you are interested in taking this route).\nFor students interested in education, urban, health, or criminal justice policy who missed out on the RPAD elective when it was offered, I strongly recommend looking at Graduate Level classes in the School of Education, Public Health, Urban Planning, or Criminal Justice. Classes with policy in the name are often good crossover classes for our students, but that is the sort of thing to put in your email to me and that might warrant a meeting and conversation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis is a suggested path to make things clear and ensure you cover your bases with classes offered on a regular and predictable schedule. However, if any of the three electives is just not your cup of tea, you can substitute it for an elective of your choice. You should enter as if you will take these three electives though so that you do not get hung up by pre-requisites.\n\n\nA good example plan:\n\n\n\nSemester\nClasses\n\n\n\n\nFirst\nRPAD 500, RPAD 503, RPAD 505\n\n\nSecond\nRPAD 504, RPAD 643, RPAD 522\n\n\nThird\nRPAD 501, RPAD 502, RPAD 626\n\n\nFourth\nRPAD 506, RPAD 507, Policy Topic Elective OR RPAD 517"

Evidence suggests that people with high PSM cluster in government and nonprofit organizations. However, reliance on cross-sectional data leaves open the question of whether observed patterns are the result of public and nonprofit organizations attracting and selecting high-PSM people or cultivating PSM through socialization within the sector. Using longitudinal data, this article analyzes the relationship between motivational bases, such as PSM, and sorting into the public, for-profit, and nonprofit sectors. The results indicate that PSM-related values, measured before labor market entry, predict the sector a person will select for employment. Moreover, the effect on sector selection does not operate through some commonly cited alternative predictor of sector employment, such as college completion. Rather, PSM predicts sorting into college majors in a manner consistent with sector sorting in the labor market.\n\n\nCitation\nHolt, S. B. (2018).

    "text": "The Impact of Demographic Representation on Absences and Suspensions\n\nAbstract\nRepresentative bureaucracy theory is central to public administration scholarship due to the likely relationship between the demographic composition of the public workforce and both the actual and perceived performance of public organizations. Primary school classrooms provide an ideal context in which to test the predictions of representative bureaucracy theory at the micro (student) level. Specifically, as parents have at least some agency over primary school students’ daily attendance, absences partially reflect parental assessments of their child’s school, classroom, and teacher. Ensuring students attend school each day represents an effort at coproduction on the part of parents. The representativeness of the teacher workforce, and specifically that of the student’s classroom teacher, is therefore likely to influence student absenteeism. Similarly, student suspensions reflect students’ relationships with their teacher, students’ comfort level in the classroom, and teachers’ discretion in the referral of misbehavior. These academically and socially important outcomes provide convenient, objective measures of behaviors that are likely influenced by street-level representation. Using longitudinal student-level administrative data from North Carolina, we use a two-way (student and classroom) fixed effects strategy to identify the impact of student–teacher demographic mismatch on primary school students’ absences and suspensions. We find that representation among street-level bureaucrats significantly decreases both absenteeism and suspensions and that these effects can be given a causal interpretation. This pushes literature forward by establishing the importance of demographic representation in shaping productive relationships between individual bureaucrats and clients.\n\n\nCitation\nHolt, S.

Formal schooling is one possible determinant of PSM. Using longitudinal data, this study analyzes the effects of civics courses and school-based community service in high school on PSM-related values. A propensity score matching strategy that compares observationally similar individuals finds that participation in school-based service activities for credit increases students’ reported prosocial values, such as helping others in the community, one underlying component of PSM-related values. However, taking a civics course does not affect PSM or associated values. The results suggest that PSM-related values are malleable and responsive to early service experiences.

    "text": "Managing Racial Diversity: Matching Internal Strategies with Environmental Needs\n\nAbstract\nAlthough demographic diversity has been of paramount concern to researchers and practitioners in public management, studies exploring managerial strategies to capitalize on and respond to the needs of diverse client populations are scarce. This article examines strategies for managing diversity as a way to buffer environmental challenges in service delivery and performance resulting from heterogeneous client demands. Findings suggest that administrators prioritize diversity efforts when faced with higher levels of regulatory violations (a performance measure). A higher percentage of black residents is associated with lower service quality. However, the effect of managerial strategies for diversity on performance is conditioned by the racial composition of the clients: as the percentage of black nursing home residents increases, diversity management efforts are associated with a lower number of regulatory violations. Similarly, at higher levels of racial heterogeneity, diversity management efforts are associated with fewer regulatory violations.\n\n\nCitation\nAmirkhanyan, A. A., Holt, S. B., McCrea, A.

    "text": "Job Mobility Among Millennials: Do They Stay or Do They Go?\n\nAbstract\nMillennials are a substantial segment of the workforce; they are perceived to be driven by higher pay, quick to be dissatisfied and leave a job, and committed to volunteering. This article examines how these perceptions translate to job mobility in terms of job switching within and across sectors, without drawing cross-generation comparisons. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 cohort (NLSY97) from 2008 to 2013, we notice a trend among millennials of frequent job switching within rather than across sectors. Job dissatisfaction is the strongest predictor of public-sector employees switching jobs within the sector. For sector switching, we find some variation: Low pay corresponds with exiting the nonprofit sector, whereas job dissatisfaction is the strongest predictor of leaving the public sector. Millennials working in the public and nonprofit sectors are less likely to switch sectors if they volunteer. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.\n\n\nCitation\nAbouAssi, K., McGinnis Johnson, J., & Holt, S. B. (2021). Job mobility among Millennials: Do they stay or do they go?.

    "text": "Examining the Influence of Representative Bureaucracy in Public and Private Prisons\n\nAbstract\nRepresentative bureaucracy theory suggests that demographic representation among street-level bureaucrats will improve outcomes for minority citizens receiving a given public service. Scholars of representation in public bureaucracies argue that the effect of bureaucrats’ demographic profile on outcomes for minority citizens becomes particularly salient in contexts where bureaucrats exercise relatively high amounts of discretion. Empirical evidence has documented this relationship in education, policing, and a variety of public programs. We extend this literature to the context of prisons, where street-level corrections staff exercise considerable discretion over inmates’ daily lives. Using prison violence and disciplinary actions to proxy for the potential effects of a representative staff on the experiences of prison inmates, we find that prisons with greater representation have fewer assaults and exercise fewer disciplinary actions. We offer evidence that the positive effects of demographic representation may not hold in privately managed prisons. We speculate that differential organizational socialization and managerial incentives may help to explain this result.\n\n\nCitation\nJohnston, J. M., & Holt, S. B. (2021).

Separately, researchers have shown that teachers improve student achievement with increasing effectiveness over their careers. We bridge these two streams of research by examining the extent to which teachers’ perceptions of racially dissimilar students vary by experience in the teaching profession. Using nationally representative data, we show that while the expectations gap between non-Black and Black teachers regarding Black students’ academic potential persists regardless of experience, the gap is much larger among first year teachers. We demonstrate that non-Black teachers with more than one year of experience have higher expectations of Black students than non-Black rookie teachers, and perhaps surprisingly, Black teachers with more than one year of experience have lower expectations of Black students compared to rookie Black teachers. We do not find such results for Latino/a students. We discuss the implications of these results for both research and practice.\n\n\nCitation\nVinopal, K., & Holt, S. B. (2019).

Extant literature consistently finds public sector workers are more likely to engage in prosocial behaviors, such as volunteering, than their peers in the private sector. Less attention has been paid to the sector gap in volunteerism along the intensive margin. Using time-diary data, which accounts for potential social desirability bias, from a nationally representative sample, this study investigates the gap between public sector workers and their private sector counterparts. The results suggest that public sector workers spend more time, on an average day, volunteering than observably similar private sector peers, and the difference cannot be explained by other observable differences between public and private sector workers. The gap in volunteer intensity is largest at the local level and among teachers. The implications of these results for research and practice are discussed.\n\n\nCitation\nHolt, S. B. (2020).

To be able to export the theory and measures of PSM to other disciplines, we need more conceptual clarity. Some suggest PSM is analogous to altruism, whereas others warn not to confound the two concepts. Is PSM separate from altruism? How does each motivational construct relate to prosocial behaviors? We use a nationally representative panel of respondents to the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) to measure both altruism and PSM among respondents before the 2016 election and measure respondents’ participation in prosocial behaviors after the 2016 election. Using linear probability models with state fixed effects, we find that although PSM and altruism predict prosocial behaviors separately, altruism has no effect after controlling for PSM. PSM is a more consistent predictor of some prosocial behaviors than altruism, particularly in more formal contexts such as volunteering with an organization.\n\n\nCitation\nPiatak, J. S., & Holt, S.

To address this, we need to differentiate PSM from related concepts, such as altruism. We examine the separate and joint influence of PSM and altruism on organizational citizenship behaviour (OCB) using a nationally representative dataset, where the two constructs are measured on a survey preceding the measurement of OCB. Separately, both altruism and PSM drive OCB. However, when examining the joint influence of PSM and altruism, we find only PSM significantly predicts OCB, which may be due to the organizational context.\n\n\nCitation\nPiatak, J. S., & Holt, S.

Despite widespread concern about teachers’ mental health, however, little empirical evidence exists on long-run trends in teachers’ mental health or the prevalence of mental health problems in teaching relative to other professions. We address this gap in the literature using nationally representative data from the 1979 and 1997 cohorts of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY). In the 1979 cohort, women who become teachers have similar mental health to non-teachers prior to teaching but enjoy better mental health than their non-teaching peers, on average, while working as teachers. However, in the 1997 cohort teachers self-report worse mental health, on average, than the 1979 cohort and fare no better than their non-teaching professional peers while teaching. Overall, teachers seem to enjoy mental health outcomes that are as good or better than their peers in other professions.\n\n\nCitation\nHolt, S. B., Wang, R., & Gershenson, S. (2020).

While qualitative and ethnographic work has found that income disparities also translate into disparities in time kept waiting for services, little evidence exists to confirm the scale and extent of socioeconomic differences in waiting time. We use time diary data from the nationally representative American Time Use Survey (ATUS) to estimate the difference between high- and low-income people in time spent waiting for basic services. We find that, relative to high-income people, low-income people are 3 percentage-points more likely to spend time waiting on an average day and their waiting spells are 12 minutes longer on average. The income gap in waiting time cannot be explained by differences in family obligations, demographics, education, work time, or travel time. Further, we find that high-income Black people experience the same higher average wait times as low-income people regardless of race. Our results suggest socioeconomic and racial inequalities in neighborhood quality, work schedule flexibility, and access to services exacerbate inequality in daily quality of life and the availability of productive time.\n\n\nCitation\nHolt, S.
