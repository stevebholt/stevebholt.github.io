One mechanism by which teachers might affect student learning is through the grading standards they set for their classrooms. However, the effects of grading standards on student outcomes are relatively understudied. Using administrative data that links individual students and teachers in 8th and 9th grade Algebra I classrooms from 2006 to 2016, we examine the effects of teachers’ grading standards on student learning and attendance. High teacher grading standards in Algebra I increase student learning both in Algebra I and in subsequent math classes. The effect on student achievement is positive and similar in size across student characteristics and levels of ability, students’ relative rank within the classroom, and school context. High teacher grading standards also lead to a modest reduction in student absences.\n\n\nCitation\nGershenson, S., Holt, S. B., & Tyner, A. (2022).

We use administrative data from North Carolina elementary schools to examine the extent to which teachers vary in their use of referrals and investigate the impact of more punitive teachers on student attendance and achievement. We also estimate the effect of teachers’ racial bias in the use of referrals on student outcomes. We find more punitive teachers increase student absenteeism and reduce student achievement. Moreover, more punitive teachers negatively affect the achievement of students who do not receive disciplinary sanctions from the teacher. Similarly, while teachers with racial bias in the use of referrals do not negatively affect academic outcomes for White students, they significantly increase absenteeism and reduce achievement for Black students. We find the negative effects of both more punitive and more biased teachers persist into middle school and beyond. The results suggest punitive disciplinary measures do not aid teachers in productively managing classrooms; rather, teachers taking more punitive stances may undermine student engagement and learning in both the short- and long-run. Furthermore, bias in teachers’ referral usage contributes to inequities in student outcomes.\n\n\nCitation\nHolt, S. B., Vinopal, K., Choi, H., & Sorensen, L. C. (2022).

    "text": "Sorting it Out: The Effects of Charter Expansion on Teacher and Student Composition at Traditional Public Schools\n\nAbstract\nSince their introduction in the 1990s, charter schools have grown from a small-scale experiment to a ubiquitous feature of the public education landscape. The current study uses the legislative removal of a cap on the maximum number of charters in North Carolina as a natural experiment to assess the impacts of charter school growth on teacher quality and student composition in traditional public schools (TPS) at different levels of local market penetration. Using an instrumental variable difference-in-differences approach to account for endogenous charter demand, we find that intensive local charter entry reduces the inflow of new teachers at nearby TPS, leading to a more experienced and credentialed teaching workforce on average. However, we find that the entry of charters serving predominantly White students leads to reductions in average teacher experience, effectiveness, and credentials at nearby TPS. Overall these findings suggest that the composition of the teacher workforce in TPS will continue to change as charter schools further expand, and that the spillover effects of future charter expansion will vary by the types of students served by charters.\n\n\nCitation\nSorensen, L.

Perhaps you’re wondering why I have directed you to a post on my professional website as an incoming advisee. Well, in my time at Rockefeller College, I’ve begun to realize that many students enter the program a little confused about navigating the bureaucracy of a university, a little confused about who to go to for what information, and anxious to get quick resolutions to these problems. I’ve also come to realize that I field many of the same questions repeatedly early on so I have found life might be a little easier for all involved if I simply created a central repository to house all of this information as a starting point for most common questions.\nI will structure this post with a general overview of the process for selecting classes, a more detailed set of starting semester courses, and some thoughts on common paths among students typically assigned to me for advising."

Well, for starters, my primary role in your time at the university is to make sure you stay on track to fulfill your degree requirements and provide insight and advice from time-to-time on things that might shape your early career path. Of course, there might be a whole host of other issues that crop up in your time at Rockefeller, from financial aid to taking temporary leaves to career and job opportunities. I find many students enter the program a little confused on where to go for information on which things, so here’s an incomplete list of people and places to get important information.\n\nYour MPA Program Handbook. I know - this sounds a little trite. But the faculty and staff poured a lot of time and thought into the design and information in the MPA Program Manual and it will always be the best place to start a search for college policies, program requirements, and directory informaion.\nThe Director of Internships and Career Services. If you have any questions or concerns about internship requirements (or waivers!) or internship/job postings, the Director should be the first person you email. In fact, this person is so important for your success, I strongly recommend you set up a meeting with them during your first semester to cover career goals and interests and get an early understanding of career opportunities. You can email career services here for any career and internship needs: rockefeller.careers@albany.edu.\nThe MPA Director. Currently, the MPA Director is Dr. Ellen Rubin and for advanced programmatic issues - credit transfers, issues with a class, or other more technical issues with the program - she is the person you should reach out to first (erubin@albany.edu).\nRockefeller College Graduate Services. We have staff that handle a range of other issues, from problems with accessing various systems to answering questions unrelated to class-taking. Email rockgradservices@albany.edu and they will either handle the issue directly or loop in the appropriate staff person to do so.\n\nAs you can see, there’s a lot of support for any issues that might come up. As your academic advisor, I play a very specific role in your time at the program and to save yourself time and headaches, I find that it’s good to know where to go for all the other things that might come up."

I will lay out some guidelines about classes to take later in another section, but here, it’s useful to have an overview of how you should approach registration. My role is to i) make sure you are fulfilling the program requirements in a timely manner and ii) provide advice on course selection when needed. Toward that end, here is how the class selection process should look in a typical situation:\n\nAccess the schedule of classes website through the Registrar’s Office on the University at Albany website. You can use this link. Start by selecting the upcoming semester in the dropdown, make sure you select Graduate Classes only, and for most instances you will also be filtering by “RPAD” in the Course Subject field. Use this to peruse the courses available that semester and create your schedule of classes that fits your course requirements and scheduling needs.\nSend me an email with i) a list of the classes you’ve taken to date in the program (if any) and ii) your proposed schedule for the upcoming semester. If needed request a meeting to discuss any questions you might have about courses to take (often, this is productive if there are two electives you are considering and unsure which would be a better fit with your long-term goals)\nAfter confirming that your proposed schedule leaves you on track, I will send you an AVN.\nUse the AVN to register.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nOutside of the occassional circumstance regarding an elective choice, you generally do not need to meet with me unless you really find yourself lost and in need of clarification. Students often feel obligated to request meetings, which slows down your registration process given scheduling conflicts, so I note this simply to underscore that there is no obligation for you to meet with me in this scheduling process if you don’t really need it."

    "text": "First and Second Semester\nThe general way to understand the MPA program is 8 core courses for generalized skills and knowledge and 4 more specialized electives. In your first two semesters, there are three possible approaches.\n\nApproach 1 - my recommended approach for most students who know their intended concentration on entry (except for Public Policy students) - provides a steady way to progress through the core while adding electives each semester to develop your more specialized concentration skills.\nApproach 2 - what I recommend for students on the fence between the two concentrations I advise (management or policy) OR who know from the start that they will be in the public policy concentration. For students on the fence, this approach gives you an early taste of what both concentrations emphasize to inform your decision without “wasting” an elective.1 For Public Policy students, this approach covers the prerequisites for the two required electives that have prerequisites.\nApproach 3 - which I only recommend in circumstances where a student is truly and completely undecided in their concentration intentions - gives you an upfront spread of more general classes to help you answer that question before taking electives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSemester\nApproach 1\nApproach 2\nApproach 3\n\n\n\n\nFirst\nRPAD 500, RPAD 504, Elective 1\nRPAD 500, RPAD 503, RPAD 505\nRPAD 500, RPAD 501, RPAD 504\n\n\nSecond\nRPAD 502, RPAD 505, Elective 2\n(if Policy) RPAD 504, RPAD 522, RPAD 643; (if Management) RPAD 505, RPAD 610, Elective 2\nRPAD 503, RPAD 505, Elective 1\n\n\nGoing Forward\n2 cores, 1 elective per semester\n2 cores, 1 elective per semester\n2 electives, 1 core per semester\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nA subtlety many students might not pickup on is that core classes are, by necessity, offered on a guaranteed and frequent schedule, while electives have a less gauranteed schedule in their cycling and offerings. While many of the electives offered in Rockefeller are cycled annually, some are cycled biennially. The unpredictability of scheduling becomes even more severe when considering electives operated by another department. Exploit the timing and scheduling flexibility to take an elective you really want to take the semester it’s offered because you don’t know if/when it will be offered again!\n\n\nFor filling in the “Elective 2” placeholders and thinking about your courses after the first two semesters, see my description of each concentration below and the key classes to look out for on the schedule."

    "text": "Public Management\nThe public management concentration focuses on key concepts and skills for managing public organizations - things like managing personnel, measuring the performance of both individuals and programs your organization operates, and thinking about contracts and grants (and the entities receiving them). The primary aim of taking this concentration is to learn how to manage the people and projects that make government run, regardless of what area of government you would like to be operating within. As you may have noticed, RPAD 610 is required for the concentration and I recommend taking it in your first semester if you are following approach 1 (i.e., you are coming in knowing you want to be in the public management concetration) or your second semester if you have decided to go the public management route after entering undecided.\nFrom there, my general recommendation is you take the following classes as they are available in scheduling following the 1 elective per semester approach:\n\nRPAD 532 Performance Measurement and Contracting\nRPAD 615 Strategic Planning and Management\n\nThis leaves you with one elective to explore other topics or areas of interest to you. I suggest using it to take either RPAD 626 (Program Evaluation) as it provides a broadly applicable skillset or a policy topics class based on your area of content interest (e.g., health policy, environmental policy, education policy - see the policy concentration in the handbook/below). If you have a job in a particular agency in mind (e.g., New York State Education Department), using your elective on a content class in that department’s area can help signal your interest and knowledge on the front end and catch you up on the broader sets of issues and current debates for helping your work once you get started.\nA good example plan:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSemester\nClasses\n\n\n\n\nFirst\nRPAD 500, RPAD 504, RPAD 610\n\n\nSecond\nRPAD 502, RPAD 501, RPAD 532 OR RPAD 615 (pending availability)\n\n\nThird\nRPAD 506, RPAD 505, RPAD 532 OR RPAD 615 (whichever not taken)\n\n\nFourth\nRPAD 503, RPAD 507, RPAD 626 OR Policy Topic Elective"

However, unlike the public management concentration, the Public Policy concentration carries a little less flexibility in your coursework and sequencing. While generally we have moved away from specific pathing in our curriculum, the Policy concentration covers some more advanced technical material in its core - material that necessitates some prerequisite knowledge to get the most out of it. I think it’s generally a good idea to take RPAD 503 (a prerequisite for RPAD 643) and RPAD 505 (a prerequisite for RPAD 626) in your first semester if you know you are going to be a public policy concentration student. From there, you will take both RPAD 522 (Politics and Policy) and RPAD 643 (Economics of Public Policy) as they are available (every Spring semester). You will then take RPAD 626 in your second Fall semester. Finally, I recommend dedicating your last elective either to one of the content area policy classes (e.g., health, environmental, or education policy) that aligns with your interests or to an advanced econometrics class if possible (RPAD 517 or a more advanced class - talk to me if you are interested in taking this route).\nFor students interested in education, urban, health, or criminal justice policy who missed out on the RPAD elective when it was offered, I strongly recommend looking at Graduate Level classes in the School of Education, Public Health, Urban Planning, or Criminal Justice. Classes with policy in the name are often good crossover classes for our students, but that is the sort of thing to put in your email to me and that might warrant a meeting and conversation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis is a suggested path to make things clear and ensure you cover your bases with classes offered on a regular and predictable schedule. However, if any of the three electives is just not your cup of tea, you can substitute it for an elective of your choice. You should enter as if you will take these three electives though so that you do not get hung up by pre-requisites.\n\n\nA good example plan:\n\n\n\nSemester\nClasses\n\n\n\n\nFirst\nRPAD 500, RPAD 503, RPAD 505\n\n\nSecond\nRPAD 504, RPAD 643, RPAD 522\n\n\nThird\nRPAD 501, RPAD 502, RPAD 626\n\n\nFourth\nRPAD 506, RPAD 507, Policy Topic Elective OR RPAD 517"

However, little is known about how teachers form expectations and whether they are systematically biased. We investigate whether student–teacher demographic mismatch affects high school teachers’ expectations for students’ educational attainment. Using a student fixed effects strategy that exploits expectations data from two teachers per student, we find that non-black teachers of black students have significantly lower expectations than do black teachers. These effects are larger for black male students and math teachers.

Evidence suggests that people with high PSM cluster in government and nonprofit organizations. However, reliance on cross-sectional data leaves open the question of whether observed patterns are the result of public and nonprofit organizations attracting and selecting high-PSM people or cultivating PSM through socialization within the sector. Using longitudinal data, this article analyzes the relationship between motivational bases, such as PSM, and sorting into the public, for-profit, and nonprofit sectors. The results indicate that PSM-related values, measured before labor market entry, predict the sector a person will select for employment. Moreover, the effect on sector selection does not operate through some commonly cited alternative predictor of sector employment, such as college completion. Rather, PSM predicts sorting into college majors in a manner consistent with sector sorting in the labor market.\n\n\nCitation\nHolt, S. B. (2018).
