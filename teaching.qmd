title: "Teaching"

My teaching is summarized here. I teach courses in public administration and statistics and teach at the undergraduate, master's, and doctoral levels. Here, I provide a brief description of the classes I teach and link to course sites where I share course materials. I have benefited greatly from the generosity of others who also make their course materials accessible so my course sites aim to serve a similar function for others.

## Classes Taught Regularly

In addition to the set of classes I teach regularly, I have prepared and taught undergraduate classes on [introductory statistics](https://stevebholt.github.io/rpad316/) and [research design and introductory causal inference](https://stevebholt.github.io/rpad399/), undergraduate courses on public administration, a doctoral seminar on [theories of democracy and public administration](https://stevebholt.github.io/rpad702/), and a [doctoral professional development seminar](https://stevebholt.github.io/rpad88x/).
