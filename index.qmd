Hello, and welcome to my website! I am an Associate Professor of Public Management at the Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy at the University at Albany, SUNY. My research focuses on public sector workforce dynamics, public organization performance, and education policy and administration. I am particularly interested in representation and motivation in the public sector workforce. I can be reached by email at sbholt\@albany.edu and found on Threads [here](https://t.co/8j933Fi7JI) and on Twitter at \@SteveBHolt. I also co-host the podcast miniseries [Mind the Teacher](https://www.american.edu/spa/dpap/mind-the-teacher.cfm) (with Seth Gershenson) about mental health in schools. Give it a listen!
